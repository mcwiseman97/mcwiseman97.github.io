   <h2>Design Principles</h2>
   <!-- ***********************************************
Each design principle needs three items:
1- The principle's name and the team member responsible for it.
2- An image (screenshot) of the mobile browser screen showing the design principle in use.
3- A discussion of how the design principle is exemplified in the picture. Be detailed but keep it to one paragraph!
************************************************* -->

   <h3>Proximity - Kayla Roberts &mdash;
   </h3>
   <img class="image" src="https://mcwiseman97.github.io/home_work/etsy_breakdown/images/proximity.jpg" alt="Screen shot illustrating proximity in use on etsy.com">
   <p> 
    As you can see, there are three different groupings of words.  They each have a larger heading, with a smaller sub-heading.  
    <br>Also, the spacing between the four images on the top are the same and are very close.  While the spacing between those 
    <br>images and those images at the bottom of the picture is larger, showing that they are separate from each other.
   </p>

   <h3>Alignment - Lucas &mdash;
   </h3> 
   <img class="image" src="https://mcwiseman97.github.io/home_work/etsy_breakdown/images/Alignment.jpg" alt="Screen shot illustrating alignment in use on etsy.com">
   <p>
    Etsy uses Alignment well as shown in the picture. All the images are perfectly aligned with equal spaces in every direction.
   </p>

   <h3>Repetition - Michael Wiseman &mdash;
   </h3>
   <img class="image" src="https://mcwiseman97.github.io/home_work/etsy_breakdown/images/repetition.jpg" alt="Screen shot illustrating repetition in use on etsy.com">
   <p>
    Repetition can easily be seen in the main page of Etsy. The most visible form is with color. The website uses orange in many places, 
    <br/>and is used well with different shades of orange so it’s not plain. The use of different shades of orange doesn’t overwhelm the user 
    <br/>but provides a warm comforting feel.
   </p>

   <h3>Contrast - Avery Tutton&mdash;
   </h3>
   <img class="image" src="https://mcwiseman97.github.io/home_work/etsy_breakdown/images/contrast.png" alt="Screen shot illustrating contrast in use on etsy.com">
   <p>
    This picture gives a great example of the contrast used on this site. Contrast can help the developer organize and better layout the page 
    <br>for a great user experience, you can also manipulate contrast in many different ways. The contrast given in the example uses color to 
    <br>catch the attention of the user and have items stand out, the developer also used different shadings of a same color to set a priority 
    <br>of where your eyes should wander and in what order.
   </p>

   <h3>Typography - Avery Tutton&mdash;
   </h3>
   <img class="image" src="https://mcwiseman97.github.io/home_work/etsy_breakdown/images/typography.png" alt="Screen shot illustrating typography in use on etsy.com">
   <p>
        You can see the organization in the different types of fonts, one type of text organizes the price, the other labels the title of each 
        <br>item and the provider to better organize the site. The organization provided by the different types of styles will give the user a 
        <br>better and more aesthetically pleasing experience. It is important though to catch the eye of the user and bring attention to the 
        <br>more important information on the page without overwhelming the user.
