   <h2>Design Principles</h2>
   <!-- ***********************************************
Each design principle needs three items:
1- The principle's name and the team member responsible for it.
2- An image (screenshot) of the mobile browser screen showing the design principle in use.
3- A discussion of how the design principle is exemplified in the picture. Be detailed but keep it to one paragraph!

   <h3>Proximity - Kayla Roberts &mdash;
    <!-- Replace this comment with the team member name responsible for proximity -->
   </h3>

   <p> 
    As you can see, there are three different groupings of words.  They each have a larger heading, with a smaller sub-heading.  
    <br>Also, the spacing between the four images on the top are the same and are very close.  While the spacing between those 
    <br>images and those images at the bottom of the picture is larger, showing that they are separate from each other.

   <h3>Alignment - Lucas &mdash;

   <h3>Repetition - Michael Wiseman &mdash;

   <p>
    Repetition can easily be seen in the main page of Etsy. The most visible form is with color. The website uses orange in many places, 
    <br/>and is used well with different shades of orange so it’s not plain. The use of different shades of orange doesn’t overwhelm the user 
    <br/>but provides a warm comforting feel.
